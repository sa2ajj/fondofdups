Fond Of Dups
============

A simple program to find duplicate files in the provided directories.

This program is just my attempt to learn a bit of OCaml.

A number of alternatives (most likely much more useful and featureful than this
little application) is listed at `WikipediA
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_duplicate_file_finders>`_.

This program was created using `OCaml 4.01.0
<http://ocaml.org/releases/4.01.0.html>`_, it might work with other versions as
well, however I did not really try it.
